## AR Campaign

AR Campaign is a project that aims to simplify the way people use Augmented Reality (AR) content in their marketing.

This page will hopefully give you a brief introduction to the project.

### SDK

We will create and provide an SDK for iOS and Android* apps, that makes it incredible easy to set up and integrate with the rest of this service.

### Standalone app

We will also build a standalone app, which purpose is to give everyone without their own app a opportunity to use AR content in their marketing. You can use this app to view the content for all public campaigns in your vicinity.

### Console and documentation

Finally we will create a interface that will enable anybody to set up an AR campaign within minutes, and we will create documentation on how everything from setting up campaings in the dashboard to integrating with the SDK. We'll have lots of best practices and guidelines, as well as graphics that you can use in your marketing to show that this campaign has additional content in AR.
